/**
 * Adding a Channel File greatly improves the performance of the JS SDK by
 * addressing issues with cross-domain communication in certain browsers.
 *
 * The channel file should be set to be cached for as long as possible. When
 * serving this file, you should send valid Expires headers with a long
 * expiration period. This will ensure the channel file is cached by the browser
 * and not reloaded with each page refresh. Without proper caching, users will
 * suffer a severely degraded experience.
 *
 * The channelUrl parameter within FB.init() is optional, but strongly
 * recommended. Providing a channel file can help address three specific known
 * issues.
 *
 * - Pages that include code to communicate across frames may cause Social
 * Plugins to show up as blank without a channelUrl.
 * - if no channelUrl is provided and a page includes auto-playing audio or
 * video, the user may hear two streams of audio because the page has been
 * loaded a second time in the background for cross domain communication.
 * - a channel file will prevent inclusion of extra hits in your server-side
 * logs. If you do not specify a channelUrl, you should remove page views
 * containing fb_xd_bust or fb_xd_fragment parameters from your logs to ensure
 * proper counts.
 *
 * The channelUrl must be a fully qualified URL matching the page on which you
 * include the SDK. In other words, the channel file domain must include www if
 * your site is served using www, and if you modify document.domain on your page
 * you must make the same document.domain change in the channel.html file as
 * well. The protocols must also match. If your page is served over https, your
 * channelUrl must also be https. Remember to use the matching protocol for the
 * script src as well. The sample code above uses protocol-relative URLs which
 * should handle most https cases properly.
