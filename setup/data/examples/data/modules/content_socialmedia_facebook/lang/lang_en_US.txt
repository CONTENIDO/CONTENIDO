AUTO_URL_HELP=Facebook users like certain web pages which are identified by their URL. If this box is checked, the like button will be linked to this article. If this checkbox is off, the URL from the first field will be used.  
LIKE_BUTTON_HELP=This is the default like button style.  
LIKE_BOX_HELP=Instead of a button, Facebook will render a box prominently showing the profile pictures of people who liked this page (if you so choose). With "Width" and "Height" you can determine the size of the box.  
STANDARD_HELP=If you choose "LIKE-Button", this will tell Facebook to use the simple default button. No like counts will be shown.
BUTTON_COUNT_HELP=If you choose "LIKE-Button", this will tell Facebook to use the small default button with a little speechbubble on the right side, telling the user about the number of likes.  
BOX_COUNT_HELP=This is very similar to the "Button count" option, but instead of the bubble being to the right, it will be on top of the like button.  
SHOW_FACES_HELP=Here you can choose to display profile pictures of people who liked this page in the LIKE-Box.
