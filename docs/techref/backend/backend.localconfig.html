<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the past, all modifications to CONTENIDO's config.php file were lost
during an upgrade.

<div class="section">
<h2>Where? What? How?</h2>
CONTENIDO now includes a local config file - config.local.php. This
file isn't overwritten during an upgrade, so you can make your changes
there (recommended by now). It is included in the main config.php file.
Remember that the config.php file is usually the first file included;
don't do any tricks like database queries there.

<h2>Frontend config?</h2>
Yep, that's also possible. Just create a file "config.local.php" in the
frontend directory. The file will be executed just after the
front_content.php's init code (so you've got all variables and database
available), but just before the magic starts (like executing the
content code etc). Note that everything is available from the backend's
config.local.php also.
