<h2>Introduction</h2>
The CONTENIDO login mechanism has been made alot easier from Version
4.4 and upwards. Logins are now directly handled by CONTENIDO's
frontend, and you only need to pass the parameters "username" and
"password" to CONTENIDO. Logins are now handled as "pro-active" logins,
which means that the methods explained here need to issued before a
protected category is accessed.
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Logging in - manually</h2>
Each frontend login can be triggered manually. In order to test your
logins, you should insert the following statement into either a layout
or module:<br>
<br>
<pre>echo $auth-&gt;auth["uid"];</pre>
This statement shows the current logged in user. For anonymous sessions
(i.e. nobody is logged in), the "uid" is always "nobody". To test the
login, create a new user in CONTENIDO's Backend, then call the frontend
like this:<br>
<br>
<pre>front_content.php?username=&lt;youruser&gt;&amp;password=&lt;yourpassword&gt;</pre>
If previously the test statement returned "nobody", it should now
display your user id.
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Logging in - automatically</h2>
Of course, the method above is pretty uncomfortable for end users. You
could simply write a module which outputs a login form - it's up to
you. All you need to do is to pass "username" and "password" - exactly
as shown above.
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Logging out</h2>
Of course, your users want to log out if necessary - just pass the
parameter "logout" with any value to the system. Example:<br>
<pre>front_content.php?logout=true</pre>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>How all this interacts with protected folders</h2>
In the past, a login form was only displayed if a protected category.
If you are already logged in with the above method, and if you have
access rights to that category, everything is alright. But if you are
not logged in or if you don't have access rights, the (pretty old) file
"front_crcloginform.inc.php" will be called.<br>
<br>
If you want to show a custom login form, you can do the following:<br>
<br>
Specify a client setting with the following values:<br>
<pre>
Type: login_error_page
Name: idcatart
Value: &lt;Specify the idcatart of the article containing the login form&gt;</pre>
<br>
You can also use:<br>
<pre>
Type: login_error_page
Name: idcat
Value: &lt;Specify the idcat of the category containing the article with the login form&gt;</pre>
<br>
and/or
<pre>
Type: login_error_page
Name: idart
Value: &lt;Specify the idart of the article containing the login form&gt;</pre>
<br>
Please note, that if the idcatart has been specified, idcat and idart are ignored. idcat and idart may be
specified both (and then the idart should be an article in the category specified by idcat) or
one of them, only.<br>
<br>
The article/category specified has to be public/online.
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Creating users</h2>
Of course, you don't want to create a user in the backend every time.
You can automate the user creation process using the class "User":<br>
<pre>
$myUsers = new cApiUserCollection();    // User Collection
$myUser = new cApiUser();    // Single user

$ret = $myUsers-&gt;create("nameofuser");

// Note the three equal signs: This checks for the boolean type
if ($ret === false) {
    // User already exists
    die("User already exists");
} else {
    // User was successfully created, now we can set the password
    $user-&gt;loadByPrimaryKey($ret);
    $user-&gt;setField("password", md5("theuserspassword"));
}
</pre>
<br>
You can also assign custom properties to your users (to attach almost
every kind of data to a user) by using the methods "setUserProperty"
and "getUserProperty". See the API documentation for more information.
