SPAW Editor PHP Edition
version 1.0.3
Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded, tried and supported SPAW Editor!

This is basically a service release. No new features were added in this release,
however some major and minor bugs fixed and 4 new languages added.

Check out ChangeLog.txt for the list of new features and bugfixes.


Many people asked about instructions on integrating SPAW Editor into
various content management systems. We don't have experience with many CMSs
and no time to dig. So it would be nice if you could share your experience with
others if you integrate SPAW into some publicly available CMS. Send your
instructions or links to pages with instructions to spaw@solmetra.com

Also if you are fluent in any of languages that are now included and 
see any typos or mistakes please report to spaw@solmetra.com

Happy editing,
Alan Mendelevich a.k.a. ailon
