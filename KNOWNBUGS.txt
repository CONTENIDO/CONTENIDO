- Backend: Some settings about expanded/collapsed rows may not be 
  stored in the database everytime (more or less optical problem).
- When using tinyMCE as WYSIWYG Editor, all XHTML formatting is lost if the
  content is saved using the Insite Editing. This is a problem of Microsoft's
  DHTML editing component, which converts the XHTML formatting to their
  "standards". Workaround: Don't use XHTML or don't use Insite Editing.
  
  This doesn't happen using Firefox/Mozilla.
